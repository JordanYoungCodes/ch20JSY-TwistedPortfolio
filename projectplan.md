Project Setup
Create the Vite App:

Run npm create vite and select React as the framework and JavaScript as the variant.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Modify the package.json as instructed to include "start": "vite" for easy startup.
Adjust the vite.config.js to set the port and auto-open the app.
Core Components:

Header Component: This will contain the developer's name and a Navigation component that links to each section.
Use react-router-dom's Link for navigation between sections.
Navigation Component: Include navigation links to "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume". Ensure the current section is highlighted based on the route.
Project Component: Reusable for each portfolio item. It will accept props like title, image, deployed URL, and GitHub repo link.
Footer Component: Add icons or links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform like Stack Overflow or Twitter.
Pages/Sections:

About Me Section: Include a recent photo/avatar and a short bio.
Portfolio Section: Use the Project component to display six projects, each with a screenshot, title, and links to the deployed app and GitHub repo.
Contact Section: A simple form with fields for name, email, and message. Use form validation to notify the user of required fields or invalid email addresses.
Resume Section: Include a link to download the resume and a list of proficiencies (skills like JavaScript, React, etc.).
Routing:

Set up routes using react-router-dom to conditionally render different sections when a navigation item is clicked.
